# Angular2JsonapiExample

This repository implements the example from [ghidoz/angular2-jsonapi](https://github.com/ghidoz/angular2-jsonapi).
An example server that provides the resources described in this example and some random data can be found here:
[https://github.com/hpawe01/angular2-jsonapi-example-server](https://github.com/hpawe01/angular2-jsonapi-example-server).
It is based on [holidayextras/jsonapi-server](https://github.com/holidayextras/jsonapi-server).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**Important**

To make this example fully work you have to also fire up the [example-server](https://github.com/hpawe01/angular2-jsonapi-example-server).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
